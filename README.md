Hi, I’m Shao.

I’m a Full-Stack Developer based in Melbourne, Australia, with a strong backend focus and hands-on experience building production-ready web applications. I primarily work with ASP.NET Core, C#, SQL, and React, and I’m comfortable across the full development lifecycle — from domain modeling and API design to frontend integration and deployment.

My background includes developing backend systems that handle business workflows, approval processes, and data-intensive operations. I have designed and implemented RESTful APIs, structured application layers following clean architecture principles, and worked with relational databases to ensure data consistency, performance, and maintainability. I also have experience integrating message-based communication and handling asynchronous processing in real-world systems.

On the frontend, I work with React to build clean and functional user interfaces that integrate seamlessly with backend services. While my main strength lies in backend development, I understand frontend workflows well enough to deliver end-to-end features independently and collaborate effectively with designers and frontend-focused developers.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer in the broadcasting systems domain, contributing to internal platforms and middleware used in large-scale operational environments. This experience strengthened my ability to work with complex business logic, legacy constraints, and reliability-focused systems.

I’m passionate about writing clear, maintainable code and continuously improving my understanding of system design, backend architecture, and real-world engineering trade-offs. I’m a Permanent Resident of Australia with full working rights and am open to full-time opportunities as a Full-Stack or Backend Developer.
